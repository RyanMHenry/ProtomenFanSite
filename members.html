				Protoman.
				The bold prototype of the Dr. Lights creations, despite this he is seen as
				Dr. Light's son. He was the bravest soldier of them all fighting to restore the
				peoples would fight, and for his will to live among humans. Throughout his time 
				on the battlefield, he, unfortunately, learns his bodies have defects. His bones,
				stones of metal. His heart a soulless nuclear reactor, and his acts are serious 
				glitches. But, he will not let this break him he will fight to the very end. His 
				voice channels through the people in the form of Hard Rock. Shocking the streets, 
				and Dr. Wily armies.  Bringing both down to knees before the will of Justice with 
				a five chord burst!

				Dr. Light.
					Proud professor and designer of the brave robots we see Patroling the streets
					known as the robots master. He longed for companionship away from the cold 
					isolation of his machines, so he built one with the intent of making a human.  
					DLN-000 Proto Man. And an advanced robot.  During a time he was content working 
					beside his colleague Wily, However everything changed. One fateful day he could 
					bother more with his partner's insanity. And Decide to cut his aid, in turn, Wily 
					went through with the plan and conjured forth an army of industrial robots. Now sad, 
					alone and defeated with only the mellow keys of acoustic piano  Dr. Light and went 
					A.W.OL. Some say while his hero's fight for his behalf these tunes fill the night, 
					calming the indifferent machines of his discontent.

					Alber  Wily. An ingenious scientist who brought the "New world of machines" Into being. 
					Long questioned and restricted by his colleague Dr. Light. Wily has broken free of his 
					restrictions and embraces his vast knowledge unleashing his full potential creating a 
					world of maximum efficiency. But even though a world of pure order exists, were beautiful,
					powerful unfeeling, uncaring machines who only exist to follow orders, and slay those who
					stand against it. He is still resisted. Why? He cannot fathom. Now he engages in his 
					self-synthesized war. With the techno beats of progress, the Synthesia of an empire.
